## Guidelines to Get a Data Engineer Job Against the Odd

In a very simple way, the guidelines are:

1. Education, education, education!!!
"You must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires"



2. Show yourself with data projects
"Data engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If youâ€™ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges like HackerRank or LeetCode."


3. Be the best friend with networking
You have to build and maintain a solid network.


4. Learn from failure
"This is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking."
For example, if you are asked a technical question and you don't know for that interview then learn for the next one ðŸ˜‰


5. Be resilient, persistent, patient, and never give up
"Resilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable."
